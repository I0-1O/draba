## 2026-05-04 — /test-phase 4

- Subagents run: static-check, unit-test, schema-check, api-smoke, security-review, type-sync
- Result: all pass
- Smoke target: local LAN host (not committed)
- Caveats: `docker compose config` skipped (docker not in bash PATH); `go test -race` skipped (no GCC/CGO on Windows — tests pass without `-race`)
- Advisories: `GET /teams/:id/events` returns `null` instead of `[]` for empty result sets; `POST /teams` returns 500 on duplicate slug (should be 409)

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 4: OpenAPI Spec & Type Generation

**Completed.** Wrote the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for all Phase 2–3 endpoints and wired up `openapi-typescript` codegen so the web package can import generated types.

### What was built

**`packages/shared/openapi.yaml`** — new file; 280 lines; covers all 12 endpoints (health, 4 auth, 3 team, 4 event) with full request/response schemas, reusable component schemas, reusable response objects, and reusable path parameters.

**Schemas defined:**
- `User`, `Team`, `TeamMember`, `TeamMemberWithUser` (allOf TeamMember + user display fields)
- `Invite`, `Event`, `AuthResponse`, `RefreshResponse`, `HealthResponse`, `ApiError`

**`packages/shared/package.json`** — added `generate` script (`openapi-typescript ./openapi.yaml -o ./src/index.ts`), `lint` script (`tsc --noEmit`), and `devDependencies` for `openapi-typescript@^7.6.1` and `typescript`.

**`packages/shared/tsconfig.json`** — minimal TypeScript config for linting the generated output.

**`packages/shared/src/index.ts`** — generated file; not to be hand-edited; contains `paths`, `components`, `operations`, and `webhooks` TypeScript interfaces derived from the OpenAPI spec.

**Root `package.json`** — added `"generate": "pnpm --filter shared generate"` to the root scripts so `pnpm generate` works from the repo root.

**`packages/web/package.json`** — added `"@draba/shared": "workspace:*"` to dependencies.

**`packages/web/tsconfig.app.json`** — added `paths` entry mapping `@draba/shared` to `../shared/src/index.ts` for reliable TypeScript module resolution.

**`packages/web/src/types/api.ts`** — new convenience re-export layer; exposes `User`, `Team`, `TeamMember`, `TeamMemberWithUser`, `Invite`, `Event`, `AuthResponse`, `RefreshResponse`, and `ApiError` as named types so callers don't reference `components['schemas'][...]` directly.

### Exit criteria — all verified

- `pnpm generate` completes with no errors (openapi-typescript 7.13.0)
- All Phase 2–3 endpoints are represented in the spec (12 paths × methods)
- `import type { Event } from '@draba/shared'` resolves cleanly — `pnpm --filter web lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) passes with zero errors

### Decisions & notes
- Used OpenAPI 3.1.0 (not 3.0.x) for native `type: ["string", "null"]` nullable support — matches the Go model pointer types exactly
- `packages/shared/src/` is generated output only; hand-edit `openapi.yaml` then re-run `pnpm generate`
- `packages/web/src/types/api.ts` is the stable import surface for the web package — it insulates callers from `openapi-typescript`'s internal path syntax

---

## 2026-05-03 — Phase 3: Core API — Events & Teams

**Completed.** Added team management, invite flow, and event CRUD endpoints.

### What was built

**New models (`internal/models/models.go`)**
- `Event` — full events table shape; all optional fields as pointers; `ArchivedAt` nullable
- `TeamMemberWithUser` — embeds `TeamMember` + user display fields for member list responses

**New repositories (`internal/db/`)**
- `team_repo.go` — `Create`, `GetByID`, `AddMember`, `GetMember`, `ListMembers` (JOIN with users), `Count`
- `event_repo.go` — `Create`, `GetByID`, `Update`, `Delete`, `ListByTeam` (optional `from`/`to` bounds)

**New handlers (`internal/api/`)**
- `team_handler.go` — `POST /teams`, `POST /teams/{id}/invites`, `GET /teams/{id}/members`
- `event_handler.go` — `POST /teams/{id}/events`, `GET /teams/{id}/events`, `PATCH /events/{id}`, `DELETE /events/{id}`
- `PATCH` uses a `map[string]json.RawMessage` decode so only supplied fields are applied

**Updated wiring**
- `server.go` — `TeamRepo` and `EventRepo` added to `Server`; seven new routes registered
- `main.go` — creates `TeamRepo` and `EventRepo` and passes them to `NewServer`
- `auth_handler.go` — register handler now adds the new user to the team when an invite is accepted

**Authorization model**
- `POST /teams` — any authenticated user (tier check before insert)
- `POST /teams/{id}/invites` — authenticated + admin role on that team
- `GET /teams/{id}/members` — authenticated + any membership
- All event endpoints — authenticated + any membership on the event's team

### Exit criteria — all verified by automated tests

- Full invite flow (`TestInviteFlow_FullCycle`): create team → send invite → register via token → list members shows both users
- Events CRUD + date range filter: 12 event tests covering create, list, list-with-filter, update (field-level patch), delete, and 404/403 error paths
- All responses verified for correct shape and HTTP status codes (29 tests total, all green)
- `golangci-lint run` passes cleanly

### Decisions & notes
- `DELETE /events/:id` permanently removes the row; soft-delete archive is a Phase 9 feature
- Invite tokens are 128-bit hex (crypto/rand), expire in 7 days; no resend mechanism yet
- Team slug is auto-derived from the name at creation; no uniqueness retry — duplicate slugs will surface as a DB error (acceptable for now, Phase 10 can improve)

## 2026-05-03 — /test-phase 3

- Subagents run: static-check, unit-test, schema-check, api-smoke, security-review
- Result: all pass
- Smoke target: local LAN host (not committed)
- Notes: `docker compose config` skipped (docker not in bash PATH on dev box); `go test -race` skipped (no GCC/CGO on Windows — runs in CI); `GET /users/me` returns 404 (not a Phase 3 assertion, not counted); low-severity advisory: `auth_handler.go:95` silently discards error from `MarkAccepted` — a DB failure there could leave an invite token reusable until expiry

---

## 2026-04-30 — /test-phase 2

- Subagents run: static-check, unit-test, schema-check, api-smoke, security-review
- Result: 5 pass (2 environment caveats, 1 advisory)
- Smoke target: local LAN host (not committed)
- Caveats: `docker compose config` skipped (docker not in bash PATH); `go test -race` skipped (no GCC/CGO on Windows host — tests pass without `-race`)
- Advisory: `DRABA_JWT_SECRET` fallback default `"change-me-in-production"` in `cmd/draba/main.go:16` — server should refuse to start if unset or at default in production

---

## 2026-04-30 — Post-Phase 2: CI & deploy fixes

### go.mod version bump (same issue as Phase 1)
`go get` auto-bumped `go.mod` to `go 1.25.0` (matching the local toolchain). This broke both CI jobs:
- golangci-lint v1.64.8 (built with Go 1.24) refuses modules targeting Go > 1.24
- `golang:1.23-alpine` in the Dockerfile can't satisfy `go mod download` for a `go 1.25` module

Fix: `go mod edit -go=1.22.0 && go mod tidy -go=1.22.0`. Two transitive deps also had to be stepped back to versions compatible with go 1.22: `golang.org/x/crypto v0.50.0 → v0.28.0`, `golang.org/x/sys v0.43.0 → v0.26.0` (which also pulled `modernc.org/sqlite v1.50.0 → v1.34.5` and its libc/memory deps). No code changes — purely dependency pinning.

### SQLite CANTOPEN on container start
Container logged `opening database: configuring database: unable to open database file: out of memory (14)`. SQLite error 14 is `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`; modernc.org/sqlite's error formatting makes it say "out of memory" for this code — misleading.

Two causes fixed:
1. **Compound PRAGMA**: `db.Exec("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;")` — `database/sql` drivers are not required to handle multi-statement strings; split into two separate `Exec` calls.
2. **No WORKDIR in prod container**: Without `WORKDIR`, the binary runs from `/` (container root). Overlay filesystems restrict WAL-mode SQLite at `/` because WAL requires creating sibling `-wal`/`-shm` files in the same directory. Fixed by adding `RUN mkdir -p /data` + `WORKDIR /data` to the `prod` Dockerfile stage, and changing the default `DRABA_DB_DSN` to `/data/draba.db`.

Portainer was also mounting a single file (`/app/draba.db`) instead of the `/data` directory — updated to mount the directory so WAL/SHM files persist alongside the database file.

---

## 2026-04-30 — Phase 2: API Foundation — DB & Auth

**Completed.** Added SQLite database layer, migration runner, full schema, JWT auth, and the three auth endpoints.

### What was built

**DB layer (`internal/db/`)**
- `db.go` — opens SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (CGO-free) + `jmoiron/sqlx`; sets WAL mode and enables foreign keys
- `migrations.go` — embeds SQL files from `internal/db/migrations/` via `//go:embed`; applies pending migrations in version order; idempotent (tracks applied versions in `schema_migrations` table)
- `user_repo.go` / `invite_repo.go` — typed repository structs; all queries go through sqlx, never touching the handler layer directly

**Schema (`internal/db/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`)**
All 12 tables: `users`, `teams`, `team_members`, `team_statuses`, `invites`, `api_tokens`, `events`, `event_tags`, `event_assignments`, `timelines`, `timeline_access`, `calendar_connections`

**Auth layer (`internal/auth/`)**
- `password.go` — bcrypt hash (cost 12) + verify
- `jwt.go` — `TokenService` issues HS256-signed access tokens (15 min TTL) and refresh tokens (7 day TTL); validates type claim to prevent refresh tokens being used as access tokens

**API layer (`internal/api/`)**
- `server.go` — dependency-injected `Server`; routes wired in `Routes()` using stdlib `http.ServeMux` method-pattern routing (Go 1.22+)
- `auth_handler.go` — `POST /auth/register` (invite-free for first user, invite token required thereafter), `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `GET /auth/me`
- `middleware.go` — Bearer token extraction + JWT validation; injects `*auth.Claims` into context
- `helpers.go` — `writeJSON`, `writeError`, `newID` (crypto/rand hex)

**Entry point**
- `cmd/draba/main.go` updated to open DB, run migrations, wire repos and token service, start server

### Exit criteria — all verified by automated tests
- `POST /auth/register` returns 201 + access/refresh tokens (first user, no invite needed)
- `POST /auth/register` returns 403 INVITE_REQUIRED for subsequent users without a token
- `POST /auth/login` returns 200 + tokens on valid credentials; 401 on wrong password
- `POST /auth/refresh` exchanges a refresh token for a new access token
- `GET /auth/me` returns the user profile with a valid access token; 401 without
- All 12 schema tables exist after migration (verified by `TestMigrate_Idempotent`)
- Re-running migrations produces no changes (idempotent)

### Decisions & notes
- Used `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGO) to keep the Docker build simple on non-CGO base images
- SQL files live at `internal/db/migrations/` (not top-level `migrations/`) because `//go:embed` forbids `..` path segments
- The top-level `migrations/` directory still exists with a copy of the SQL for documentation purposes; the embedded one at `internal/db/migrations/` is the authoritative source
- JWT refresh tokens are stateless (signed JWT, not stored in DB); cannot be individually revoked without a token blocklist — acceptable for v1, can be upgraded in Phase 9

---

## 2026-04-29 — Phase 1: Project Infrastructure

**Completed.** Turned the documentation-only scaffold into a buildable, lintable, containerized monorepo.

### What was built
- Go module initialized at `packages/api/` (`github.com/I0-1O/draba/packages/api`, `go 1.22.0`)
- Minimal Go HTTP server at `cmd/draba/main.go` with a single `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok"}` endpoint
- React + TypeScript + Vite project at `packages/web/` (manually scaffolded — see roadblocks)
- Tailwind CSS v4 wired via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin; design tokens kept as `hsl()` values
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` wiring all three packages
- `golangci-lint` config at `.golangci.yml`
- GitHub Actions CI (`ci.yml`) — Go build/vet/test/lint + web build on push to `master`
- Docker publish workflow (`docker-publish.yml`) — builds `prod` stage and pushes to `mewcus/draba` on push to `master`
- `docker-compose.yml` for local dev (API with Air hot-reload + Vite dev server)
- Container confirmed running in homelab (Portainer), health endpoint responding

### Roadblocks & resolutions

**`pnpm create vite` refused to run non-interactively in a non-empty directory**
Cancelled with "Operation cancelled" when the `packages/web/src/` files already existed.
→ Created all Vite project files manually (`package.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, etc.)

**`corepack enable` failed with EPERM**
Needed admin rights to write to `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`.
→ Used `npm install -g pnpm` instead.

**esbuild blocked by pnpm build script restrictions**
pnpm warned "Ignored build scripts: esbuild" and the Vite build failed.
→ Added `"pnpm": { "onlyBuiltDependencies": ["esbuild"] }` to root `package.json`.

**CSS `@import url()` warning in Vite build**
Tailwind v4 generates `@layer` rules before the Google Fonts `@import url()`, which CSS spec requires to come first. Build warned on every run.
→ Moved font loading to `<link>` tags in `index.html` instead of `@import` in CSS.

**`go.sum` missing, Docker build failed**
`go mod download` in the Dockerfile failed because `go.sum` wasn't in the repo. `go mod tidy` doesn't create `go.sum` when a module has no external dependencies.
→ Committed an empty `go.sum` file.

**golangci-lint exit code 3 (configuration error)**
Two causes: (1) `typecheck` is a built-in meta-linter, not a configurable one — listing it in `enable` causes a config error. (2) `gosimple` and `unused` were merged into `staticcheck` in newer golangci-lint versions.
→ Removed `typecheck`, `gosimple`, and `unused` from `.golangci.yml`.

**golangci-lint refused to run: Go version mismatch**
`go mod init` auto-set `go 1.26.2` (the local installed version). golangci-lint v1.64.8 is built with Go 1.24 and refuses to lint modules targeting a newer Go version.
→ Lowered `go.mod` to `go 1.22.0` (minimum actually needed — for the `"GET /path"` method routing syntax introduced in 1.22). Also reverted Dockerfile back to `golang:1.23-alpine`.

**Node.js 20 deprecation warnings in CI**
GitHub Actions warned that `actions/checkout`, `setup-go`, `setup-node`, etc. run on Node.js 20 which is being deprecated.
→ Added `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: true` env var to all CI jobs to opt into Node.js 24 now.

**Port conflict in homelab**
Port 8080 was already in use on the host.
→ Mapped container port 8080 to host port 8081 in Portainer. No code changes needed.
